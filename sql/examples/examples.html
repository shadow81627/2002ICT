<P>&nbsp;</P>



<P>There are two groups of questions below (solutions are given at

each exercise). Complete these tasks and check solutions. Be reminded

that for any English query there are several possible solutions.</P>



<UL>

   <LI><A HREF="#Anchor4236">Group I</A> (query only) these SQL

   statements can be executed against the COMPANY database owned by

   your convener.

   

   <LI><A HREF="#Anchor5815">Group II</A> (including updates). These

   SQL statements should be executed against your own COMPANY

   database instance. How to create your own copy of the COMPANY

   database instance is also described in the

   <A HREF="../README.html"> instructions</A>.

   

   <P>Beware: Especially when you are experimenting with update

   queries you should realise that anything you did to the database

   (including the effects of unintended updates) remain in the

   database as long as you don't delete them.</P>

   

   <P>When experimenting with updates you may want to

   start again with a clean

   original COMPANY database (use the scripts), instead of cleaning the database

   from the effects of unintended updates.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Question Group I</B></P>



<P>[<A HREF="q1.sql">Q1</A>] Select the names and ssn's of employees

whose supervisor works more then 10 hours on any one project</P>



<P>[<A HREF="q2.sql">Q2</A>] List the names of female managers.</P>



<P>[<A HREF="q3.sql">Q3</A>] List the minimum, maximum, and average

salary of department managers (<A HREF="q3b.sql">alternative

solution</A>)</P>



<P>[<A HREF="q4.sql">Q4</A>] List the name and ssn of those employees

who work on all projects located in Stafford.</P>



<P>[<A HREF="q5.sql">Q5</A>] List every possible pair of projects

that are located in the same city.</P>



<P>[<A HREF="q6.sql">Q6</A>] List the name and ssn of those

department managers who work more then 10 hours on some project. You

must eliminate duplicate tuples from the result.</P>



<P>[<A HREF="q7.sql">Q7</A>] List, in alphabetical order, the names

(together with their ssn) of those employees who have exactly one

dependent.</P>



<P>[<A HREF="q8.sql">Q8</A>] List the names of those departments that

have no employee who works on no project at all.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Question Group II</B></P>



<P>[<A HREF="q9.sql">Q9</A>, <A HREF="q9b.sql">Q9b</A>] Create a new

department with department manager "Ahmad Jabbar", department number

3, and department name "Rockets". The location of the department

should be "Brisbane".</P>



<P>to test your solution look at the result of

<A HREF="q9test.sql">executing</A></P>



<PRE>   	 select D.DNAME, D.DNUMBER, D.MGRSSN, L.DLOCATION

         from DEPARTMENT D, DEPT_LOCATIONS L 

	    where  D.DNUMBER = L.DNUMBER

&nbsp;</PRE>



<P>[<A HREF="q10.sql">Q10</A>] Let James Borg be supervised by the

department manager of the department located in Stafford. (You must

NOT explicitly include in your update statement any department number

values!) to test your solution look at the result of

<A HREF="q10test.sql">executing</A></P>



<PRE> 	   select name ssn, superssn from employee

&nbsp;</PRE>



<P>[<A HREF="q11.sql">Q11</A>] Create a view called employee_location

with an entry for each employee [name and ssn] - location

[location_name] pair such that the employee works on a project at

that location. Eliminate duplicate tuples from the view.</P>



<P>to test your solution look at the result of

<A HREF="q11test.sql">executing</A></P>



<PRE>	    select * from employee_location;

&nbsp;</PRE>



<P>[<A HREF="q12.sql">Q12</A>] Using the above created view

"employee_location" create a view called sum_location such that for

each location it is shown how many employees work there. (The view

should show attributes: location_name, number_of_employees)</P>



<P>to test your solution look at the result of

<A HREF="q12test.sql">executing</A></P>



<PRE> 

		select * from sum_location</PRE>
